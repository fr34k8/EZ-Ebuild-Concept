EZ-Ebuild-Concept
=================

Gentoo Ebuild Concept in QT Designer , Although I Lack the skills to make it, 
the Idea is to make a GUI were making Ebuild is so simple even a novice can do it.
or convert know packages or make Ebuild making Extremly simplistic to the point Sys-Admins 
whith really Limited Programing 
Skills Like myself can be adding new packages and building them Rappidly.

Irks thier are packages I would like to use, and though I can src ./configure make etc, I then have to do them on many
systems , Server Desktop , Laptop , and the '''Backlog''' of Beggers... like me and the Waiting.... for a package atom 
for emerge and or building binary for system , some packages no mater how trivial have broken lesser disros.
a python lib dint break the debian or gentoo when hand done but broke the Redhat/Fedora core Irrevenrly .
7zip python for python based tools to use it like file roller , granted this has been many ages ago, this has been one
shap stab of a lesson in why package managment can be handy as with a resuce disk and chroot one can Un-F@#$ themselves.

Idea is to make ebuild even nested complicated , simpler, eassier even for newer Gentoo admins. 
(And i mean NOOB or a few notches up)

This is a QT menu set of files, IT's mainly a though experament , but I have seen Ez-ebuilder or the like on gentoo bugs 
for YEARS....n Years... 

hopefully it helps inspire an ez-ebuilder IDE 

If you know not much in bash or python above hellow world.... and or dysleix SOB like me , programing a real son-of-a-Bi#t!@% ..
As an IT security Admin I hate wating for packages I could use, like now, plus this would make Gentoo easier to port projects too
sooner than latter

Feal free to fork this to Death and work it.
